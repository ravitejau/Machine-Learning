# HandwrittenDigitsRecognitionwithLogisticRegressionandkNN

Implemented logistic regression model and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm for MNIST handwritten digits recognition. 
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of hand written digits, divided into 60,000 images as trainingset and 10,000 images as testset. 
Each image has 28Ã—28 pixels which are considered as the features of the image.
