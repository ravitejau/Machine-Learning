# Handwritten Digits Recognition with Logistic Regression and kNN

Implemented logistic regression model and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm for MNIST handwritten digits recognition. 
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of hand written digits, divided into 60,000 images as trainingset and 10,000 images as testset. 
Each image has 28Ã—28 pixels which are considered as the features of the image.


# Algorithm for finding out the similar clusters with K means and PCA

Implemented k-means algorithm for finding out the similar clusters with k value ranging from 2 to 10. Until convergence the algorithm would iterate where in each iteration it would update the cluster memberships of each data point and the cluster centers.
