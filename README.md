# HandwrittenDigitsRecognitionwithLogisticRegressionandkNN

Implemented logistic regression model and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm for MNIST handwritten digits recognition. 
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images ofhandwrittendigits,dividedinto60,000imagesastrainingsetand10,000imagesastestset. 
Each imagehas 28×28 pixelswhichareconsideredasthefeaturesoftheimage. Youcandownloadthe data set from Blackboard. 
To ease your work, two additional code ﬁles are provided to load the imagesandlabels.

Since the data set is large, you might need to come up with a good way to optimize youralgorithmandspeedupthecomputation. 
IfyouareusingPython,theonlythirdpartylibraries allowed are numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
